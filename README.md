# Matreshka.js examples
This repo contains examples for [Matreshka.js framework](http://matreshka.io/). All scripts are written in ECMAScript 2015 and might not work in outdated browsers.

I would recommend to start your journey from [Hello World](./hello-world), [Matreshka.Object example](./matreshka-object) and [Matreshka.Array example](./matreshka-array).

If you've noticed problems (eg live example doesn't work), feel free to report an issue or make pull-requests.
